Leamprov is an improvised comedy community group based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire. The group is run by the members for the members and encourages all abilities to have a go at improvised comedy in a safe and friendly environment.  Test

The group was founded and is managed by James Cannon, who has over 8 years of experience doing improvised comedy, performing across the county in a number of different improvised troupes.

The group currently focuses on short form improvised comedy and aims to book a number of workshops, jams and performance across the year. Currently workshops take place on a Monday night at The Band Factory in Leamington spa with monthly jams happening at the end of each month and shows every 3 months. 

As well as running workshops and jams, Leamprov has a performing show, "The Elephants In The Room", which regularly performs at Temperance in Leamington Spa, and has performed as part of Coventry City of Culture, The Generate Festival and will be performing at the Brighton Fringe üêò

We aim to provide a supportive and welcoming environment to people of all ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds, physical abilities, cultural views, sexual orientations, religions, and nationalities, and are currently working to encourage greater diversity and accessibility in the improv scene.
