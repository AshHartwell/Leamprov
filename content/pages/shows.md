#### 'Elephant in the Room' is our Edinburgh Fringe show and a quick-fire improvised sketch show of fast paced short improv games and sketches. The Elephant in the Room is... we have no idea what the show will be about!

#### 'Back in the Room' is our improvised one act play. We open with a group of unlikely characters together, in a location suggested by you, and the story and fun will unfold before your eyes!
