#### The Elephants In The Room - An Improvised Comedy Show

Leamington's improvisers will turn your suggestions into hillarious scenes. Nothing is written and nobody knows what is going to happen - including the cast!<img src="/uploads/06-09-21-26.jpg" width=500px>

Taking inspiration from audience suggestions, the show will create a series of comedy sketches and games completely off-the-cuff.

* Where: Temperance Leamington Spa
* When: 01 / February / 2021
* Time: 7:30pm (Doors open at 7pm)
* Tickets: Â£5
