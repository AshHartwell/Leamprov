\
We are proud to bring you a special, 2-part completely improvised Halloween comedy show! We will start with a series of spooky comedy sketches and games. Based off our regular sell-out show "The Elephant in the Room" the group will take inspiration from audience suggestions creating comedy scenes completely off the cuff, but with a Halloween twist. It will then be followed by our long form troupe with their spooky verion of "Back in the Room!"

At Temperance Bar, 33 Bath Street, Leamington Spa, CV31 3AF
