We are so excited to be part of the Nottingham’s Smash Night! with our long form show ‘Back to the Room,’ where w**e get a group of characters together, in a location suggested by you. How did they get there? What secrets are lurking in their backstories? Where will their recollections and confessions take them? And what will happen once they’re back to the room?

At The Playwright, 38 Shakespeare St, Nottingham, NG1 4FQ
