We also often include our long form troupe and enjoy celebrating specials days within our performances such as International Women's Day, Valentines Day, Halloween, and look out for our annual Christmas improv panto!

#### 'Elephant in the Room' is our Edinburgh Fringe show and a quick-fire improvised sketch show of fast paced short improv games and sketches. The Elephant in the Room is... we have no idea what the show will be about!

#### 'Back in the Room' is our improvised one act play. We open with a group of unlikely characters together, in a location suggested by you, and the story and fun will unfold before your eyes!

##### At The Knight & Garter, 14 Hotel Street, Leicestershire, CV31 3AF
