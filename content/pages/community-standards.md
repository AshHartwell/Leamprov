Group Guidelines

\- We want all to be able access our group and aim to break down financial barriers. If a member would like to join or continue to be part of the group but is unable to because of their financial situation, the group will support them with free entry to workshops and jams.

\- To continue to make the group accessible the committee will decide if to put prices up for workshops and Jams. This will only be done if the group is running at a loss.
