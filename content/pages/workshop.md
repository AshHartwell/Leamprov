We run a series of workshops which are suitable for everyone. Most people who start attending our workshops have never tried improv before, so don't worry - you will quickly pick it up!

Before attending, please see our [community standards](../community-standards/).

We hold workshops most Mondays at the Band Factory - Please check our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/leamprov/) to see when we are running our next workshop. Your first workshop is free, and only Â£3 per week thereafter.

You can find the band factory at the map below:
