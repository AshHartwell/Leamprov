We run a series of workshops which are suitable for everyone. Most people who start attending our workshops have never tried improv before, so don't worry - you will quickly pick it up!

Before attending, please see our [community standards](../community-standards/).

We hold workshops most Mondays at the Band Factory - Please check our [meetup](https://www.meetup.com/leamprov/) to see when we are running our next workshop. Your first workshop is free, and only Â£3 per week thereafter.

You can find the band factory at the map below:

#### What's it like?

The workshops are fun, no-pressure and open to all skill levels! Each month covers a particular topic or theme, however every session is beginner-friendly so don't worry about joining part way through the month. We have included some photos of the workshops below.

Once a month we also host a 'jam', where rather than learning new skills everyone gets a chance to perform if they want to. The photo below is from our Halloween Jam.

As well as workshops and jams we are also a community and have built great friendships - after workshops everyone is welcome (but not obliged!) to stay for a drink, and we also host  socials (like the murder mystery below, nights out, Christmas meals and even trips together).
