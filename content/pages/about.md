Leamprov is an inclusive community for anybody who wants to try, learn, or perform improvised comedy! Based in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, we hold weekly workshops for all abilities, with a friendly, no-pressure environment which will get you up and doing your first scenes in no time.\
\
Our popular live show, 'Yes, And...!' takes place every month at Temperance, showcasing the talents of our members and often providing new improvisers with the opportunity to perform on stage for the first time! We have also performed at festivals all over the UK, including Nottingham Comedy Festival, Leicester Comedy Festival and the Brighton Fringe.\
\
The group was founded and is managed by James Cannon, who has over 8 years of experience doing improvised comedy, performing across the country in a number of different improvised troupes.\
\
Leamprov aims to provide a supportive and welcoming environment to people of all ages, genders, ethnic backgrounds, physical abilities, cultural views, sexual orientations, religions, and nationalities, and are currently working to encourage greater diversity and accessibility in the improv scene.
