Improv is the art of creating comedy or theatre from scratch, on the spot, from audience suggestions.

Leamprov was founded in 2018 to establish a community of improv within Warwickshire. We have members from all over the midlands who are joined together by a love of improv!

There are a few ways you can get involved:

* **Love seeing comedy?** We do shows! See our upcoming shows [here.](Leamprov "Shows")

* **Want to learn improv?** We hold weekly workshops for all abilities. Most of our members that join have never done improv before, and we have a friendly community and no-pressure environment which will get you up and doing your first scenes in no time!

* **Want to perform?** We regularly rotate the cast in our shows so that anyone who is ready to perform from our workhops gets the chance to be in the Leamprov shows (if they want to of course - there is no pressure to perform!).
